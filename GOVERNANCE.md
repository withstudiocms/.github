# GOVERNANCE

This document outlines the governance model for StudioCMS. This includes descriptions of the various roles, the nomination processes, code review processes, and Code of Conduct enforcement.

ðŸ‘‰ **All community members must follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/withstudiocms/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).** Consequences for CoC violations are detailed in the Moderation section.

## Involvement

StudioCMS (and by extent the surrounding ecosystem) are entirely open source, meaning anyone can contribute to the repositories and code or the translations for the project. We also recognize involvement in the community by providing helpful information or helping people out in our [Discord Server](https://chat.studiocms.dev) should they have questions regarding the project. Another way to get involved is by (for example) writing a blog post about StudioCMS or creating a plugin. No contribution is too small!

**Anything that supports the StudioCMS community and ecosystem is a valuable contribution!**

## Contributor Roles

We recognize different levels of contribution as three different **Contributor Roles.&#x20;**&#x45;ach level comes with a new set of privileges and responsibilities.

Any member of the community can attain these roles, no matter their coding skill or experience.

The most important things that we look for in a contributor are:

* Being around - 
* Being a positive member of the community - 

All contributor roles are granted for as long as the individual wishes to engage with the community and project. Contributors can choose to leave the project voluntarily at any point.

Should a contributor violate the Code of Conduct, or should an Exalted member deem it necessary to the long term health of the community, a role can be revoked at the descretion of an Exalted member.

### Level 1 - Honoured

This role is given to members of the community to have proven they have interest in helping out with the project.

**Honoured members** are the community moderators, making sure everyone can feel safe and welcome. They have **moderation privileges**, and are trusted to deal with spam or CoC violations.

**Examples of recognized contributions**

* Helping with translations (for example, adding a new language to the docs or package translations)
* Submitting a merged pull request on GitHub to any of the projects
* Helping with documentation
* Helping people on Discord, GitHub or other platforms by answering questions
* Blogging, Vlogging, Podcasting etc. about StudioCMS
* Similar contributions

**Privileges&#x20;**

* New role on Discord: `@honoured` 
* New name color on Discord: **purple.**

### Level 2 - Revered

This role is given to **Honoured members** who are interested in helping with maintaining the long-term health of the project by joining the team.

**Revered members** are the first line of defence when it comes to new issues and PRs. Having said that, they do not need to write code. Revered members can also help with translations and community moderation on Discord.

**Examples of recognized contributions**

There is no minimum amount of contributions needed to reach this level. You are just expected to show **sustained** involvement over a longer period of time (a couple months at least).

### Level 3 - Exalted

**The Exalted role** is offered to people who have a larger-than-usual impact on the project and community. Members of the Exalted team lead the project, ensuring that the project stays on track and the community can grow long term and in a healthy way.

## Governance Playbook

This section includes helpful information for contributors of any level on how they can act in certain scenarios and how certain processes function.

### Voting

All nomination processes and RFC submissions are subject to a vote by all or some of the team members. This section outlines what is voted on, who can vote, and how many votes are needed in each specific case.

**General Voting Rules**

* A member may abstain from a vote.
* If a member does not vote within 24 hours, they effectively abstain.
* A nomination vote lasts 24 hours.

#### Voting: Honoured (L1) Nomination

This process starts once a valid nomination for a new Honoured member has been made.

1. A vote thread should be started in the private `#honoured-chat` channel on Discord.
2. A vote thread can be created by any existing Honoured member or above.
3. Once the thread has been created, all discussion can happen in private within that thread.
4. The 24 hour voting period begins with the thread's creation.
5. Voting can be done in the thread itself.
6. Once the vote is completed, the thread is deleted.
7. The vote must receive an overwhelming majority (70%+) to pass.

If the vote passes, the nominee will be invited to the Honoured team. Should they accept, all privileges are made available to them.

#### Voting: Revered (L2) Nomination

This process starts once a valid nomination for a new Revered member has been made.

1. A vote thread should be started in the private `#revered-chat` channel on Discord.
2. A vote thread can be created by any existing Revered member or above.
3. Once the thread has been created, all discussion can happen in private within that thread.
4. The 24 hour voting period begins with the thread's creation.
5. Voting can be done in the thread itself.
6. Once the vote is completed, the thread is deleted.
7. The vote must receive an overwhelming majority (70%+) to pass.

If the vote passes, the nominee will be invited to the Revered team. Should they accept, all privileges are made available to them.

#### Voting: Exalted (L3) Nomination

This process starts once a valid nomination for a new Exalted member has been made.

1. A vote thread should be started in the private `#exalted-chat` channel on Discord.
2. A vote thread can be created by any existing Revered member or above.
3. Once the thread has been created, all discussion can happen in private within that thread.
4. The 24 hour voting period begins with the thread's creation.
5. Voting can be done in the thread itself.
6. Once the vote is completed, the thread is deleted.
7. The vote must receive an overwhelming majority (70%+) to pass.

If the vote passes, the nominee will be invited to the Exalted team. Should they accept, all privileges are made available to them.

#### Voting: RFCs

StudioCMS features and new libraries in the ecosystem are discussed using a model called [Consensus-seeking decision-making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus-seeking_decision-making). This model attempts to achieve consensus on all significant changes to StudioCMS, but has a fallback voting procedure in place if consensus appears unattainable.

**Who can vote:** All Exalted and Revered members.

1. Anyone can submit an RFC to suggest changes to StudioCMS or one of the surrounding libraries.
2. A trivial change can be discussed and approved entirely within the RFC GitHub issue, as long as there are no objections from Exalted or Revered members. This is not considered a formal vote.
3. A non-trivial, significant change should be discussed within the RFC and approved during an RFC meeting call/vote. In some cases, an RFC may be approved outside of an RFC meeting using Pull Request reviews as a proxy for votes.
4. During an RFC meeting/vote, the person leading the call/vote will attempt to achieve consensus on the RFC proposal.
5. **If consensus is reached:** the RFC is approved.
6. **If consensus is not reached:** The RFC author and Core members must make all reasonable attempts to resolve issues and reach consensus in GitHub or a follow-up RFC meeting. The process of reaching consensus can take time, and should not be rushed as long as all participants are making a reasonable effort to respond.
7. **If consensus still cannot be reached:** The Core team may invoke [rough consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough_consensus) to resolve an RFC that has not achieved absolute consensus, as described below (borrowed from the [IETF](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2418)):

> Working groups make decisions through a "rough consensus" process. StudioCMS consensus does not require that all participants agree although this is, of course, preferred. In general, the dominant view of the the Exalted team shall prevail. (However, "dominance" is not to be determined on the basis of volume or persistence, but rather a more general sense of agreement). Consensus can be determined by a show of hands, humming, or any other means on which the the Exalted team agrees (by rough consensus, of course). Note that 51% of the the Exalted team does not qualify as "rough consensus" and 99% is better than rough. It is up to the Exalted team to determine if rough consensus has been reached.

#### Voting: Governance Changes

A vote to change the GOVERNANCE document can be initiated by any Exalted member by submitting a pull request to the `GOVERNANCE.md` file.

If the PR is not made by any existing Exalted member, it can be closed by any maintainer without a vote. However, any Exalted member can initiate a vote on that PR if they choose so.

Any existing Exalted member can vote. However, all Revered members and above are encouraged to discuss the change and provide input on the proposed changes. These opinions should be taken into consideration by the Exalted members when voting.

1. The PR itself is to be used as the place for discussions about the change.
2. A 3 day voting period begins when the PR is created.
3. Voting can be done by either approving the PR (for) or requesting a change (against).
4. The vote must receive a simple majority (50%+) to pass.

If the vote passes, the pull request can be merged and the changes take effect immediately.

### Moderation

Outlined below is the process for Code of Conduct violation reviews.

#### Reporting

Anyone may report a violation. Violations can be reported in the following ways:

* In private, via email to one or more team members.
* In private, via direct message to any team member on Discord.
* In public, via a GitHub comment (mentioning `@withstudiocms/honoured`).
* In public, via the project Discord server (mentioning a team member or one of the relevant roles).

#### Review

If a report doesnâ€™t contain enough information, the reviewers will strive to obtain all relevant data before acting.

The reviewers will then review the incident and determine, to the best of their ability:

* What happened.
* Whether this event constitutes a Code of Conduct violation.
* Who, if anyone, was involved in the violation.
* Whether this is an ongoing situation.

The reviewers should aim to have a resolution agreed very rapidly; if not agreed within a week, they will inform the parties of the planned date.

#### Resolution

Responses will be determined by the reviewers on the basis of the information gathered and of the potential consequences. It may include:

* Taking no further action
* Issuing a reprimand (private or public)
* Asking for an apology (private or public)
* Permanent ban from the GitHub organization and Discord server
* Revoking a role entirely
